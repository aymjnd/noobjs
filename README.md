# noobjs
 noobjs is not a package for you to use and have fun. it's just a short for 'noob in nodejs'. the goal of this project is to provide the most basic crud, user registration with password hash, authentication level, pagination and search query. That will make a complete nude cms framework so noobist and nudist can use noobjs to power up their project without straying too far just to learn what is node js. express-generator, mongodb ce, mongoose
 
 ### environment setup
 install node 8.11.x, npm 6.4.x, mongodb ce. the package.json will automatically download what you need. just follow the installation guide.
 
 ### installation
npm install

npm start

visit ```localhost:3000```

### so noob!
